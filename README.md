## 👋 Overview
![Octavian Tails On The Phone](images/otter_phone.jpeg)

The Openline Voice platform allows WebRTC to PSTN calling

## 🚀 Installation

Download using the following command

### set up a minikube environment

* This process has been tested onUbuntu 20.04 the install process may need to be adapted for other platforms
* If you use codespaces, be sure to use the 4 core environment
* The voice network can not run on arm64, x86_64 must be used


#### Run the deployment script

```
deployment/k8s/local-minikube/0-build-deploy-openline-voice-local-images.sh build
```

after the script completes you can validate the status of the setup by running
```
kubectl -n voice-dev get pod
```

if you are not running the minikube on your local machine and the minikube is behind a nat you will probably need to install the turn server to have audio
```
./1-start-turn.sh
```
To start the tunnels for the core services you can run the folowing
```
./2-start-tunnels.sh
```
